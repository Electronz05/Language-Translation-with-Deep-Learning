# Language Translation with deep learning

For this project we build a RNN sequence-to-sequence learning in Keras to translate a language A to a language B. I choose to translate english to french. However our system is pretty general and accepts any other language pair (e.g. english/french). By defauft, we use ANKI dataset which can be easy download [there](http://www.manythings.org/anki/). Sequence-to-sequence learning (Seq2Seq) is about training models to convert sequences from one domain to sequences in another domain.
